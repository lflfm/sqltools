# SQLTools for Oracle

by [Aleksey Kochetov](https://sourceforge.net/u/akochetov/)  
  
I actually didn't know/notice before that this project was actually on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlt/) so I put the sources downloaded from the [official website](http://www.sqltools.net/) here.  
  
Recently the project was updated with version 2.0 so I updated it here, but anyone should really just be looking into the Official site and/or SourceForge.  

*the `readme.txt` file is not the same as this markdown, it's the official readme.txt from SourceForge*
