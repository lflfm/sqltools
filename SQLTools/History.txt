    - compatibility with VC++ 2010 (SQLTools.sln-2010.sln/SQLTools.vcxproj)

Version 1.6 build 15 (2011-12-25)
    Bug fixes:
    - Find Brace (Ctrl+[) and brace highlighting cause an exception under some conditions
    - DDL reengineering and Object Viewer show zero column size for RAW type
    - Fixed some typos in messages

Version 1.6 build 14 (2011-11-27)
    Bug fixes:
    - brace highlighting is wrong if the context is horizontally scrolled.
    - define/undefine can be erroneously executed while "Execute Current"
      is searching for the beginning of the current statement.
      The substitution variables can be changed as the result.

Version 1.6 build 12 (2011-11-20)
    Improvements:
    - Added highlighting for matching brace, two color properties "Highlighting"
      and "Error Highlighting". Taken from sqltools++ but it was altered.
    - Two environment variables ORACLE_HOME and TNS_ADMIN were added to "About Dialog"
      and bug reporting
    - Table and view columns can be sorted alphabetically. "Object List" gets its own
      property page in Settings.
    Bug fixes:
    - current schema synonyms are not highlighted when current_schema <> user account

Version 1.6 build 11 (2011-11-15)
    Improvements:
    - "Object Viewer" is able to show
        package/type functions and procedures,
        parameters for stand alone functions and procedures,
        "references" tables for tables (the old "referenced tables" node was renamed
        to "referenced by")
    - "Object Viewer" behavior was changed slightly. If a found object is a package or type
      then its specification is automatically displayed (the old implementation wants user
      to select one of them).
    - Highlighting for user objects. Objects are selected by the current schema
      rather then user. Quoted identifiers are not supported.
      "Refresh object cache" command was added under "Session" menu.
    - "Safety" combo box was replaced with "Read Only" checkbox in Connection dialog.
      "Read Only" toggled item was added under "Session" menu.
    - "Slow network" checkbox was added in Connection dialog.
      if this option is checked then "Object List" and "Object cache" are not refreshed
      automatically on connect.
    - The program can connect to a database that is mount but not open.
      The same should apply to ASM instance. The feature was taken from SQLTools++.
    - Text selection by mouse should be smoother on older computers
    Bug fixes:
    - "Object Viewer" is incompatible with Oracle 8.0.X (broken in 1.5 build 21/22)
    - DDL reengineering returns wrong column size for CHAR types in AL32UTF8 database
    - DDL reengineering prints Zero for INITIAL, MINEXTENTS, MAXEXTENTS in 11g database
    - Connection dialog opens too slow if the number of stored connection is above a hundred
     (the problem was introduced in 1.6)

Version 1.6 build 6 (2011-11-03)
    Improvements:
    - "File Manager" has basic integration with Windows context menu
       that allows access to TortoiseSVN / CVS commands using the application menu
    - "File Manager" allows to execute/rename/delete files and folders
    - "File Manager" file type filter is finally implemented
    - "File Manager" shows file/folder information in tooltips
    - "File Manager" settings page has been added to control new features

Version 1.6 build 4 (2011-10-20)
    Improvements:
    - "Execute Current" is smarter now, you do not need to place the cursor
      on the first line of a statement before execution. It finds the beginning
      of the the statement based script syntax rules (statements have to be
      separated by ';' and '/' for PL/SQL stuff). If you like old TOAD style execution
      then it is supported too (check "Execute Current Alt"). The new settings page
      allows change default behavior for these 2 commands.
    - Bulk execution commands "Execute" and "Execute from "Cursor position" have
      "Halt Execution On Error" option. That works like in SQLTools++ but it first shows
      an error and then asks if you want to cancel or continue script execution.
    - Additionally single statement execution commands can highlight and automatically
      show the beginning and end of the current statement.
    - the editor does not have 64K line limitation, now it can handle 2GB lines in theory.
    - "File Panel" restores the last selected tab when application restarts
    - improved stability of XML settings storage and recovery encrypted connection
      information.
    Bug fixes:
    - file custom.keymap is missing
    - IOT table has extra PK definition if "No storage for PK,UK" is checked
    - Find Object F12 does not recognize an object name if it is sql*plus keyword
    - Load DDL Script Ctrl+F12 throws the exception "Invalid object type"
      on a synonym that is not longer valid

Version 1.5 build 22 (2011-10-03)
    improvement:
    - Added an option to use INI file for supplemental settings instead of the registry
    bug fixes:
    DDL reengineering fails on source lines longer than 128 chars (inroduced in build 21)

Version 1.5 build 21 (2011-10-02)
    Improvements:
    - execute in SQL*Plus taken from sqltools++ with minor changes
    - added "Test and Reconnect" from sqltools++
    - DDL reengineering supports CHAR/BYTE column length symatntecs
    bug fixes:
    - FindReplace dialog can go beyond the display screen and stay there
    - DDL reengineering fails on altered Oracle OBJECTS/TYPES
    - "Object List" can show dropped objects after reapplying new filter conditions

Version 1.5 build 20 (2011-09-28)

    Improvements:
    - refresh on synonyms tab "Object List (Alt+3)" has been speeded up for 10g and above
    - added JOIN, INNER, OUTER to sql keywords (remove old language.xml)
    - added "Open Settings Folder" in "Tools" menu
    - a small fix for CASE expression in PLS/SQL language support
    - "Find Object" <F12> and "Load DDL script" <Ctrl>+<F12> do substitution
      before searching for an object
    - improved cursor position / selection indicator has been borrowed from sqltools++
    - commit/rollback dialog on exit allows cancel exit
    - block indent keeps a selection anchored to a text
    - DDL reengineering supports compound triggers for 11g
    - DDL reengineering supports constraints on views
    - DDL reengineering supports NOVALIDATE and RELY for constraints
    bug fixes:
    - deleting selection extended beyond EOF causes EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION
    - the application hangs if user sets either Indent or Tab size to 0
    - /**/ comments after END of a procedure cause a compilation error
    - DDL reengineering fails on wrapped pl/sql procedures
      because all_source.text might contain multiple code lines
    - block undent does not work correctly if Tab size > Indent size
    - editor gutter might not show syntax nesting correctly during incremental parsing
    - PL/SQL Analyzer fails on auth/wrapped packages
    - PL/SQL Analyzer fails on packages with startup/shuldtown/run procedures
      (those are script keywords)
    - PL/SQl Analyzer fails on grant/revoke
    - some bug fixes taken from sqltools++ by Randolf Geist
    - DDL reengineering fails on IOT tables w/o overflow

Version 1.5 build 14 (2011-09-01)

    SQLTools has been released under GNU GPL v3 (updated from v2 to v3).

    "Find Object" <F12> and "Load DDL script" <Ctrl>+<F12> use an updated object name resolver
    that can handle ALTER SESSION SET CURREN_SCHEMA = <Schema>

    Improvements in DDL reverse engineering:
    - implemented PARALLEL clause for tables, indexes and clusters
    - implemented event triggers

    Improvements in "Object List (Alt+3)":
    - Schema list control got new addition to the context menu.
    It allows quick switch between previously selected schemas (session live scope)
    - Changed a default action for the table list. <DblClick> will load DDL
    instead of switching to "Object Viewer". <Alt>+<DblClick> will show the
    current selection in "Object Viewer"
    - <Del> accelerator is not linked with "Drop" action anymore for safety reason.
    You should use <Ctrl>+<Del> as a short cut for "Drop"

    A minor bug fix for Drag&Drop from Grid component

Version 1.5 build 10 (2009-05-06)
    bug fix - execution of a part line selection does not support bind variables
    bug fix - dbms_output line limit increased from 255 to 4000 chars
    bug fix - "SQL Quick Reference guide" search/index tabs miss some keywords (sqlqkref.chm)
    some improvements taken from sqltools++ by Randolf Geist (2007 version)
    some small fixes in "Find Match" Ctrl+]

Version 1.5 build 9 (2007-10-1)
    Improvements (some taken from sqltools++ by Randolf Geist):
    - redesigned PL/SQL syntax analyzer ("Find Match" Ctrl+] works better)
    - redesigned Connect Dialog, connection information is stored encrypted in XML file
    - the program settings are stored as XML in %APPDATA%/GNU/SQLTools (private)
      or <Program Folder>/SharedData (shared) depending on user choice

    - improved keyboard navigation in "Object List"
    - added Recyclebin to "Object List"
