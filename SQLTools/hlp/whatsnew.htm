        <h3>What&#39;s new in 2.0</h3>
        <HR SIZE="3">
        <h4>Unicode support</h4>
        <p>The program partially supports Unicode/UTF now. The editor works with European languages w/o any issues but eastern characters are not supported mainly because the Windows <strong>monospaced</strong> fonts are actually not fixed-width for those code pages. The data grid, on other hand, should handle any texts.</p>
        <H4>New docking window framework</H4>
        <p>The control panels like &quot;File Panel&quot;, &quot;History&quot;, &quot;Open Files&quot;, &quot;Object Viewer&quot; can be docked more easily, as well as stacked in tabs. Additionally panels can &quot;Auto hide&quot; in the docking mode. The window tab control &quot;Workbook&quot; is more functional and nicer than in the version 1.9.</p>
        <H4>Re-implemented &quot;Find In Files&quot;</H4>
        <p>The external grep program was replaced with the internal implementation which is faster and more functional. See <a href="file_find.htm"><strong>Find in Files</strong></a> for more details.<br></p>
