        <h3>SQLTools 2.0</h3>
        <HR SIZE="3">
        <h4>Aleksey Kochetov Copyright © 1997-2021</h4>
        <P>SQLTools is a light weight and robust frontend for ORACLE database. It offers a 
            powerful text editor, a sql console, object browser and a few useful tools. It 
            has small footprint and it is fast as Oracle SQL*Plus. SQLTools does not need 
            an installation so you can copy it on usb stick.</P>
        <P>SQLTools is not comprehensive as TOAD or PLSQL Developer and never will provide 
            so much functionality but some people like its clean and fast UI.</P>
        <H4>Contributors</H4>
        <P>Many thanks to Tomasz Drzewiecki, Ken Clubok, Benjamin Tellier, Michel Traisnel 
            for&nbsp;ideas, coding&nbsp;and help.</P>
        <P>Many features were borrowed from SQLTools++ by Randolf Geist
        </P>
        <H4>System requirements</H4>
        <P>The program&nbsp;is&nbsp;developed and tested under Windows 7 including 64-bit 
            but it is still 32-bit application so it has to work under older Windows 
            XP/2003 and Vista.</P>
        <P><strong>&nbsp;Properly installed 32-bit version of Oracle Client 8i/9i/10g/11g/12c or Instant Client is 
            required. </strong></P>
        <H4>Server Requirements</H4>
        <P style="Z-INDEX: 0">Oracle versions 8i/9i/10g/11g/12c. SQLTools 1.3.0.12 is the last 
            version of SQLTools that supports Oracle 7.3 or 8.0.</P>
